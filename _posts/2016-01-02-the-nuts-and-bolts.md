# The Nuts & Bolts 

We have always enjoyed beautiful design and clear communication. We love the process of figuring out what your audience needs to know, and how to communicate the uniqueness of your business. We really do! 

Our goal is to provide you with great designs and a communication strategy that gives you the confidence to show the world who you are and what you have to offer!

**Travis & Amy **

We have been designing for small businesses, non-profits, freelance clients and personal projects for 17 years. We each have unique design perspectives and love bouncing ideas back and forth.  Our top priorities (read 'loves') are Jesus, each other and our busy family.  Travis spends the rest of his time reading, watching movies and thinking too much. Amy loves to decorate -- and redecorate -- vicariously through Pinterest, as well as bringing her family on the adventure of new recipes!

We look forward to helping you through your personal or business communication needs.
