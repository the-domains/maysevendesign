# Travis & Amy 

We have been designing for small businesses, non-profits, freelance clients and personal projects for 17 years. We each have unique design perspectives and love bouncing ideas back and forth. 

Our top priorities (read 'loves') are Jesus, each other and our busy family. Travis spends the rest of his time reading, watching movies and thinking too much. Amy loves to decorate -- and redecorate -- vicariously through Pinterest, as well as bringing her family on the adventure of new recipes!
